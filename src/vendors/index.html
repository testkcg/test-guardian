                <p>
                    <i>This page is for current Koch company vendors and consultants only. If you are not a current vendor or consultant, please do not complete and return the paperwork noted below. If you want information about becoming a Koch company vendor or consultant, please send an email to info@kochind.com; with Attn: Vendor Request in the subject line.</i>
                </p>

                <p>
                    As a Koch company vendor who has submitted an invoice or signed contract, we are required by United States Internal Revenue Service regulations to obtain additional documentation for our files before an invoice can be properly processed.
                </p>

                <p>Please select and complete the applicable form noted below. Forms and instructions can be downloaded from the IRS Web site. Forms should be returned to the appropriate Koch company accounts payable department via fax or by mail to: Accounts Payable, 4111 E. 37th St. North, Wichita, Ks. 67203</p>

                <p>It is important to note that this documentation will not be filed with the US IRS.  This documentation is for our files in the event of an audit by the IRS as proof of proper withholding.  If we do not receive the proper documentation, the IRS requires us to withhold tax at the maximum rate (up to 30 percent) on any dividend, interest or other income on US securities paid to your account.</p>

                <p><b>US Residents</b> (including US Resident Alien)</p>

                <p><b>W-9/Taxpayer Identification Number Information</b> — <u>Complete Part 1, 2 and 3</u> and return to the appropriate Koch company via fax or by mail to: Accounts Payable, 4111 E. 37th St. North, Wichita, KS 67220.</p>

                <p>Failure to complete the form may result in a 28% backup withholding on reportable payments we make to your company.</p>

                <p><b>For Non-US Residents</b> (Corporation, Partnership or other entity formed outside the US)</p>

                <p><b>NOTE:</b> The original W-8 form (no scanned, faxed, or photocopies will be accepted) must be returned via US mail. Please send to the appropriate Koch company. Attn: Accounts Payable, 4111 E. 37th St. North, Wichita, KS 67220.</p>

                <p><b>W-8BEN/Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for US Tax Withholding</b> — Your company should complete a Form W-8Ben if your company is (a) a foreign resident, (b) the beneficial owner of an amount subject to withholding, and (c) claiming a reduced rate or exemptions from withholding due to tax treaty benefits.
                <br/>
                For income from activities performed within the US, complete Part I, 2 and 4 of the form. Note that your company must provide a US Taxpayer Identification Number and the specific treaty information requested in Part 2 if you are claiming a reduced rate or exemption from withholding due to tax treaty benefits. See below for information about obtaining a Taxpayer Identification Number.</p>

                <p>Failure to complete the form may result in a 30% withholding (foreign-person withholding rate) on reportable payments.</p>

                <p><b>W-8ECI/Certificate of Foreign Person’s Claim for Exemption from Withholding on Income Effectively Connected with the Conduct of a Trade or Business in the US</b> — Your company should complete a Form W-8ECI if your company is (a) a foreign resident, (b) the beneficial owner of US source income that is, or deemed to be, effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business with the US. If your company is receiving both effectively connected and not effectively connected income, your company must provide both a Form W-8ECI (for the effectively connected income) and the Form W-8BEN (for the income that is not effectively connected). For income that is effectively connected to the trade or business in the US, complete Part 1 and 2 of the form.</p>
