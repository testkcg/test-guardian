                            This important step seems so obvious that you’ll be tempted to skip it, but consider this: if you don’t know who you are and what you want, how are you going to convince anyone to hire you? Get in touch with your interests, passions and goals so that you can better sell yourself to potential employers in your resume and interviews. Here are just a couple of the resources out there to aid your self-evaluation:

                            <p>
                                Results from a study at Syracuse University revealed that half of transitioning military veterans left their first job within one year, and nearly 75 percent within 18 months. Rather than jumping into the first job that comes your way, make it your goal to succeed in a private sector career that you will enjoy long-term. Instead of asking yourself “what job could I do?” ask, “what career will I pursue?” 
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                        Write to the job. Every job description is unique, so each resume should also be unique.

                                        Eliminate the "objective" paragraph to give the recruiter more time on the body of your resume. If  required, craft one specific to the targeted job and indicate an interest in modest advancement.

                                        Your resume should not look like an efficiency report. Rather than duties, highlight accomplishments – show how you added value to your organization using quantifiable and measurable terms.

                                        Never allow the recruiter to assume what skills you acquired through your experiences. Instead, clearly state them.

                                        Write straightforward, active statements that showcase your relevant skills, experiences, accomplishments and certifications for all of the requirements listed in the job description. Provide the specifics of your accomplishments and how they contributed to the success of your previous organization. Quantify them if you can.

                                        Don’t oversell your abilities. Just because you worked on a high-level staff does not mean that you are an executive leader.

                        <p>
                            On a solid resume, job description requirements on the left will connect to a personal skill or experience you’ve listed on the right. Remember that these skills and experiences came directly from your resume. If they don’t match up, you might not be qualified for the job.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There should be little or nothing in your resume that doesn’t have a line going back to the job description. This ensures that you don’t conceal your relevant strengths with a lot of unnecessary verbiage.

                            Perceptions Are a Reality
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            As a veteran interviewing for a civilian role, your skills could be misinterpreted based on your delivery and demeanor. The following are common perceptions and some tips to keep in mind. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>STRENGTHS:</strong><br />
                            <strong>Critical and creative thinking skills</strong> – Veterans often demonstrate these sought-after skills, which also offer a strong baseline for entrepreneurship. 
                        <p>
                            <strong>Compliance</strong> – Top companies look for candidates who can balance requirements versus risk and have the ability to hold themselves and others accountable.
                        <p>
                            <strong>Sense of urgency</strong> – This is a strength, but do be careful. When overplayed, it can be perceived as too intense.
                        <p>
                            <strong>Compassion</strong> – Leaders and managers who exhibit compassionate leadership traits enable their team to reach self-fulfillment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>NEUTRAL:</strong><br />
                            Keep in mind that though you have strong attributes, broad experiences and valuable skills, you may be lacking experience in one or more critical areas. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>WEAKNESSES:</strong><br />
                            <strong>Flexibility</strong> – Relax. Stiff posture and short responses feed the stereotype that military veterans are not flexible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Humility</strong> – Rather than stating that everything you do is a success, show your dedication to truth, a willingness to listen and learn, and the ability to sincerely seek criticism.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Change</strong> – Be open to change. Military veterans are viewed as checklist-oriented, afraid of having their ideas challenged or challenging the ideas of others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Emotion</strong> – The civilian world wants you to show a passion for your work and in the pursuit of your goals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Word Choice</strong> – Eliminate military words and titles, also known as jargon. This avoids confusion and delivers your message or point more clearly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Control</strong> – Exhibiting controlling leadership qualities feeds the perception that military veteran leaders are “drill sergeants.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Intensity</strong> – Military leaders and managers can be stereotyped as “blindly charging the hill.” Be open to challenge and listening to the ideas of others.
                        </p>

                                    Before you apply for a role, verify your qualifications. Keep in mind that some military and civilian job titles are similar, but the requirements could be vastly different.
