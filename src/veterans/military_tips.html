                            15 Tips to Ready Your Resume
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            A solid resume could score you an interview for the job of your dreams, so make sure yours is well prepared. 
                        </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Write to the job. Every job description is unique, so each resume should also be unique. 
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Eliminate the "objective" paragraph to give the recruiter more time on the body of your resume. If  required, craft one specific to the targeted job and indicate an interest in modest advancement. 
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Your resume should not look like an efficiency report. Rather than duties, highlight accomplishments – show how you added value to your organization using quantifiable and measurable terms. 
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Never allow the recruiter to assume what skills you acquired through your experiences. Instead, clearly state them. 
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Write straightforward, active statements that showcase your relevant skills, experiences, accomplishments and certifications for all of the requirements listed in the job description. Provide the specifics of your accomplishments and how they contributed to the success of your previous organization. Quantify them if you can. 
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Don’t oversell your abilities. Just because you worked on a high-level staff does not mean that you are an executive leader. 
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>
                                        Do include specific and relevant leadership and management experiences, especially if you are applying for a leadership or management role. 
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>
                                        Limit your professional skills – also referred to as core competencies, areas of expertise or strengths – to four to six. Specialize and focus these to the job description, so the recruiter sees that your strengths are suitable for the responsibilities spelled out in the job description.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>
                                        Servicemen and servicewomen are comfortable with diversity in the workplace and are uniquely educated and qualified to work on or lead diverse teams. Highlight any education, teamwork or experiences pertaining to diversity that you successfully led. 
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>
                                        Highlight your risk management experiences and concentration on safety, emphasizing compliance and your ability to hold yourself and others accountable.  
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Mention teamwork, cooperation and collaboration – soft skills the business will most assuredly be looking for.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>
                                        Be concise – Easy-to-read resumes get read. Reduce the amount of text on the page.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                       Other than job titles, remove EVERY military reference including ranks, organization names, titles,  school names, equipment titles, etc.  
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                       Know your audience. Use words that are understood in the private sector or the specific business: enterprise, supervisor, director, manager, employees, etc.

                            On a solid resume, job description requirements on the left will connect to a personal skill or experience you’ve listed on the right. Remember that these skills and experiences came directly from your resume. If they don’t match up, you might not be qualified for the job.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There should be little or nothing in your resume that doesn’t have a line going back to the job description. This ensures that you don’t conceal your relevant strengths with a lot of unnecessary verbiage.

                            Perceptions Are a Reality
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            As a veteran interviewing for a civilian role, your skills could be misinterpreted based on your delivery and demeanor. The following are common perceptions and some tips to keep in mind. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>STRENGTHS:</strong><br />
                            <strong>Critical and creative thinking skills</strong> – Veterans often demonstrate these sought-after skills, which also offer a strong baseline for entrepreneurship. 
                        <p>
                            <strong>Compliance</strong> – Top companies look for candidates who can balance requirements versus risk and have the ability to hold themselves and others accountable.
                        <p>
                            <strong>Sense of urgency</strong> – This is a strength, but do be careful. When overplayed, it can be perceived as too intense.
                        <p>
                            <strong>Compassion</strong> – Leaders and managers who exhibit compassionate leadership traits enable their team to reach self-fulfillment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>NEUTRAL:</strong><br />
                            Keep in mind that though you have strong attributes, broad experiences and valuable skills, you may be lacking experience in one or more critical areas. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>WEAKNESSES:</strong><br />
                            <strong>Flexibility</strong> – Relax. Stiff posture and short responses feed the stereotype that military veterans are not flexible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Humility</strong> – Rather than stating that everything you do is a success, show your dedication to truth, a willingness to listen and learn, and the ability to sincerely seek criticism.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Change</strong> – Be open to change. Military veterans are viewed as checklist-oriented, afraid of having their ideas challenged or challenging the ideas of others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Emotion</strong> – The civilian world wants you to show a passion for your work and in the pursuit of your goals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Word Choice</strong> – Eliminate military words and titles, also known as jargon. This avoids confusion and delivers your message or point more clearly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Control</strong> – Exhibiting controlling leadership qualities feeds the perception that military veteran leaders are “drill sergeants.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Intensity</strong> – Military leaders and managers can be stereotyped as “blindly charging the hill.” Be open to challenge and listening to the ideas of others.
                        </p>

                            <strong>To prepare for the Q&amp;A portion of the interview, consider these specific trouble spots for veterans.</strong>

                                    For situational-based questions, the interviewer is assessing your performance in the situation. Avoid answering in the typical military “bottom-line-up-front” method. Instead, address your actions, the response to your actions, your counter-action and the end result.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                     Avoid rambling responses. Instead, provide specific answers to the questions asked of you. 
                                </p>

                                    Recruiters report that veterans often don’t ask questions, even when given the opportunity, feeding the perception that the veteran is unwilling to learn.
